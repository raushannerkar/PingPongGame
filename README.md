# Ping-Pong_Game using CPP

A terminal-based Ping Pong game for two players, built using C++. Inspired by the classic "2 Player Games" mobile app, this project replicates the fast-paced paddle-and-ball gameplay experience entirely within a console environment. Players can control paddles using keyboard inputs and compete in real time.
